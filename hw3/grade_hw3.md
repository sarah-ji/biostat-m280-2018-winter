### Overall Grade: 99/100

### Quality of report: 10/10

-   Is the homework submitted (git tag time) before deadline?

    Yes. `Mar 2, 2018, 5:01 PM PST`.

-   Is the final report in a human readable format html?

    Yes, `html`.

-   Is the report prepared as a dynamic document (R markdown) for better reproducibility?

    Yes. `Rmd`.

-   Is the report clear (whole sentences, typos, grammar)? Do readers have a clear idea what's going on and how are results produced by just reading the report?

    Yes. Good job!

### Correctness and efficiency of solution: 50/50

-   Q1 (25/25)
    -   Report and Shiny app look very high quality.
-   Q2 (25/25)

### Usage of Git: 10/10

-   Are branches (`master` and `develop`) correctly set up? Is the hw submission put into the `master` branch?

    Yes.

-   Are there enough commits? Are commit messages clear?

    Yes.

-   Are the folders (`hw1`, `hw2`, ...) created correctly?

    Yes.

-   Do not put a lot auxillary files into version control.

    Yes.

### Reproducibility: 9/10

-   Are the materials (files and instructions) submitted to the `master` branch sufficient for reproducing all the results? (-1 pt)

    Use this path `saveRDS(LA_payroll, "./hw3_280_shinyapp/LA_payroll.rds")` instead for better reproducibility.

-   If necessary, are there clear instructions, either in report or in a separate file, how to reproduce the results?

    Yes.
