Use Linux shell commands to answer following questions.

1. How many persons are in the data set (statisticians call this n)? How many SNPs are in the data set (statisticians call this p)?

There are n = 959 people in the sataset. 

```{bash, echo= FALSE, eval = FALSE}
wc -l /home/m280-data/hw1/merge-geno.fam
```

There are 8348674 SNP's in the dataset.

```{bash, echo= FALSE, eval = FALSE}
wc -l /home/m280-data/hw1/merge-geno.bim
```


2. Which chromosomes does this data set contain? How many SNPs are in each chromosome?

This dataset contains chromosomes 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21.

```{bash, echo= FALSE, eval = FALSE}
awk -F " " '!_[$1]++' /home/m280-data/hw1/merge-geno.bim | awk '{print $1}'
```

There are SNP's in each chromosome.

3. MAP4 (microtubule-associated protein 4) is a gene on chromosome 3 spanning positions 47,892,180 bp â€“ 48,130,769 bp. How many SNPs are located within MAP4 gene?
